# Test
This repository has been created to help with understanding how version control works.
This will serve as a model for future repositories. 

## Version SP70
This is a revised version of CSY18

There are three R files
+ [Create Data.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Create%20Data.R) - revised from v.CXY18
+ [Modelling.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Modelling.R) - revised from v.CXY18

And the file Simple Plot.R has been removed.

The file [Testing out version control.pdf](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Testing%20out%20version%20control.pdf) has been revised from v.CXY18.

## Version CXY18
In this original version we have a set of three R files:

+ [Create Data.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Create%20Data.R)
+ [Modelling.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Modelling.R)
+ [Simple Plot.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Simple%20Plot.R)

The file [Testing out version control.pdf](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Testing%20out%20version%20control.pdf) describes details of how these files link together.
