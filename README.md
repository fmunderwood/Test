# Test
This repository has been created to help with understanding how version control works.
This will serve as a model for future repositories.

## Version 1 - Original
In this original version we have a set of three R files:

+ [Create Data.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Create%20Data.R)
+ [Modelling.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Modelling.R)
+ [Simple Plot.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Simple%20Plot.R)

The file [Testing out version control.pdf](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/blob/master/Testing%20out%20version%20control.pdf) describes details of how these files link together.
