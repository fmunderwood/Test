# Test
Testing out version control

This repository is a place to demonstrate how version control works.

# Version 0 - original

The original repository contains three R files:
+ [Create_Data.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/edit/master/Create%20Data.R)
+ [Modelling.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/edit/master/Modelling.R)
+ [Simple_Plot.R](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/edit/master/Simple%20Plot.R)

and a pdf [Testing_out_version_control.pdf](https://github.com/fmunderwood/Test/edit/master/Testing%20out%20version%20control.pdf) that describes how these three R files interact.
